# Optimization 301 for Data Scientists!



Here you will find the hands-on material from the [Optimization 301 for Data Scientists](https://whova.com/portal/webapp/Vti3dgwQi9Vkfd8AhCde/) training.
You can review the Jupyter Notebooks here. For each session both the complete version and incomplete is available. If you want to test yourself and try out some of the exercises, you should start with the not-completed-versions of the notebooks and then compare with the completed versions.
